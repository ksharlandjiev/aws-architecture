# Concurrency issue on an e-commerce website
On an e-commerce website, there is a product and 50 of them are available. You have to design a system - DB(relational) and application design including APIs (noo need to document the spec) so that only the first 50 people who add to the basket and buy it get the product. Imagine there are 50,000 concurrent users looking at the same product and trying to buy it. Once an item is added to the basket, it is locked down to that user. The user then has 10 mins to complete the purchase. After 10 mins, if not purchased, it will be made available to the next available user.
